# (alT(r)UI(s)t)

A TUI library for Rust. Or, rather, for me to learn Rust by writing a TUI library.

## Todos

- [ ] Frame view
- [ ] ZStack view
- [ ] Alignment for Stack views

### Attribution

- The view DSL is inspired by SwiftUI.
- The rendering logic is HEAVILY inspired by [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui).
