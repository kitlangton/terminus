# TERMINUS

A TUI library for Rust. Or, rather, for me to learn Rust by writing a TUI library.

### Attribution

- [ ] Create a ForEach view
- [ ] Audit pub vs pub(crate) functions

### Inspiration + Blatant Theft

- The view DSL is inspired by SwiftUI.
- Various aspects of idiomatic Rust DSL design were pilfered from [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui), particularly for ViewId and State management.
- The rendering logic is _HEAVILY_ inspired by [rui](https://github.com/audulus/rui).
