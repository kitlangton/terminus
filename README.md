# TERMINUS

A TUI library for Rust. Or, rather, for me to learn Rust by writing a TUI library.

## Todos

- [x] Frame view
- [x] GeometryReader
- [x] Alignment for Stack views
- [x] ZStack view

### Attribution

- The view DSL is inspired by SwiftUI.
- The rendering logic is HEAVILY inspired by [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui).
